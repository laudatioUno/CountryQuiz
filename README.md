# CountryQuiz

Quiz to learn countries, flags and outlines – the 46 countries of Europe with their capitals.
Made for exam preparation at school (7th grade): pupils practise on their phone or computer, one question at a time, with immediate feedback and the correction. The user interface is in German.

## Features

- **Flags** (*Flaggen*): see a flag, type the country and its capital
- **Outlines** (*Umrisse*) in three levels
  - *Leicht*: choose the country from 4 names
  - *Mittel*: choose the matching flag from 4 flags
  - *Schwer*: type the country
- Small states (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City) appear as a map excerpt with their position marked
- Answer options from neighbouring countries or similar flags, shuffled anew every time
- Tolerant answer checking: umlauts, case and small typos don't matter, words that sound the same count (Lichtenstein, Warshau), the correct spelling is always shown
- *Kurz* (15 random countries) or *Komplett* (all 46)
- Results stored in SQLite; evaluation at the end with the place in the ranking
- Public rankings per game type, level and length, top 5 on the start page, CSV export
- No login, no external services, no JavaScript framework

## Requirements

- PHP **8.0 or newer** with `pdo_sqlite` and `mbstring` (standard on almost every web host)
- A folder `data/` that PHP can write to
- Apache: the included `.htaccess` files protect the database. With nginx, set `DB_DATEI` in `config.php` to a path outside the web root.

## Installation

1. Download `countryquiz-<version>.zip` from the [releases](../../releases).
2. Unpack it and upload the contents of the folder `countryquiz/` to your web space (e.g. the web root of the domain).
3. Make sure `data/` is writable for PHP. The database is created with the first result.
4. Open the site in the browser.

Settings (number of countries in *Kurz*, tolerant checking on/off, database path) are in `config.php`.
A detailed guide in German is in [LIESMICH.txt](LIESMICH.txt).

## Update

1. Upload the files of the new release and overwrite the old ones. **Keep the folder `data/`** – it holds the results.
2. Open the site. If the database needs an update, the page «Update nötig» appears: click **GO**. A backup copy (`data/resultate-sicherung-<date>.sqlite`) is made first; all results are kept.

If you changed `config.php`, apply your changes again after uploading.

## Release

1. In a pull request: raise `APP_VERSION` in `version.php` and add a section for the new version to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Merge the pull request. The release is created **automatically**: the workflow sees the new version in `version.php`, runs the self test, builds `countryquiz-<version>.zip` and publishes the release (tag `v<version>`) with the changelog section as release notes.
   A merge that does not change `version.php`, or changes it without a new version, creates no release.
3. Manually, if ever needed: **Actions › Release › Run workflow** with the version (e.g. `1.1.0`).

Every pull request gets a test ZIP: **Checks › CI › Summary › Artifacts**.

## Development

```sh
php -S localhost:8000          # run locally
php tests/selftest.php         # check data, answer checking and answer options
bin/build-release.sh           # build the release ZIP into build/
```
